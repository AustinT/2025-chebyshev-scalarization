# Visualization of Chebyshev and augmented scalarization for my blog post

This repo contains a single script to create an html visualization with plotly.

The blog post associated with this is:
<austint.github.io/blog/2025-05-12-chebyshev-scalarization/>

Running the script will produce a standalone HTML visualization.

Running with the `--website` flag will produce a version which excludes `plotly.js` file
(and instead points to a copy of it on my website).
